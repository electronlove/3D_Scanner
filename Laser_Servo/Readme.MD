**Assembly Instructions for Servo-Mounted Line Lasers**

Servo mounting assembly for line laser.

- The servo disk mount is designed to accommodate 25T micro servo. Plate is 25mm round with 4 x 12 mm hole spacing. Screws onto servo with a button M3 screw.  

- The servo mounts were designed for MG996R servos but should fit similarly sized servos.  The servo mounts screw into the disks with 3mm button screws.

- The laser mount will accommodate 12mm laser modules. For this purpose, I used Aixiz line lasers, e.g. see http://www.aixiz.com/store/product_info.php/cPath/54/products_id/382

- The assembly is desinged to mount onto a 3D Laser Scanner to improve focus.

- Parts can be printed at 35% infill.  Supports are recommeded for the servo mounts if bridging is not optimized.
